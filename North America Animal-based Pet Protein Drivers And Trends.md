<p><h2>North America Animal-based Pet Protein Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The increasing awareness among pet owners regarding the nutritional needs of their pets is one of the primary drivers for the growth of the animal-based pet protein market in North America. As more consumers seek high-quality, protein-rich diets for their pets, demand for animal-based protein sources like chicken, beef, and fish is rising. This trend is fueled by a growing preference for premium pet food products, which are often marketed as being closer to natural, biologically appropriate diets. Pet owners are also becoming more conscious of the health benefits these proteins provide, such as improved coat condition, muscle development, and overall vitality.</p><p>Another significant trend in the North American animal-based pet protein market is the shift towards sustainable sourcing and transparency in production. With increasing concerns about environmental impact, pet food companies are focusing on sourcing protein from ethical, sustainable sources. This trend is being driven by both consumer demand for products that align with environmental values and regulatory pressure for more transparency in food production. Additionally, the rise of personalized pet food services, which cater to specific dietary needs, is accelerating the adoption of animal-based proteins, further pushing market expansion in North America.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=840466&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=285" target="_blank">North AmericaAnimal-based Pet Protein Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaAnimal-based Pet Protein Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Animal-based Pet Protein Market size was valued at USD 4.95 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.25 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.2% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaAnimal-based Pet Protein Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Mars Petcare</Li><Li> Nestle Purina Pet Care</Li><Li> Hill's Pet Nutrition</Li><Li> The J.M.
