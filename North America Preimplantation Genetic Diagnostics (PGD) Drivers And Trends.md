<p><h2>North America Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The North American preimplantation genetic diagnostics (PGD) market is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of genetic disorders and the growing demand for assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Rising awareness of genetic diseases and the benefits of early diagnosis through PGD is encouraging more individuals and couples to opt for genetic screening during in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Additionally, advancements in genetic testing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction, are enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of PGD, leading to greater adoption of these services across the region.</p><p>Another key driver of the PGD market in North America is the rising trend of personalized medicine and the shift toward precision healthcare. As patients seek tailored treatments to prevent hereditary conditions, PGD offers a valuable solution for identifying genetic abnormalities before embryo implantation. Moreover, increasing governmental support and reimbursement policies for ART procedures, along with a growing number of fertility clinics and healthcare facilities offering PGD services, are further contributing to market expansion. The trend towards improving patient outcomes and enhancing family planning options is also propelling PGD adoption in North America.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=345510&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=285" target="_blank">North AmericaPreimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaPreimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market size was valued at USD 1.2 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaPreimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Illumina</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.</Li><Li> Agilent Technologies</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Perkinelmer</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Cooper Surgical</Li><Li> ABBott Laboratories</Li><Li> Natera</Li><Li> Inc.</Li><Li> Rubicon Genomics</Li><Li> Oxford Gene Technology</Li><Li> Yikon Genomics</Li><Li> Scigene</Li><Li> Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI)</Li><Li> Genea Limited</Li><Li> Hamilton Thorne</Li><Li> FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific</Li><Li> Nidacon International</Li><Li> Vitrolife AB</Li><Li> Merck</Li><Li> INVO Bioscience</Li><Li> IVFtech</Li><Li> Gonagen Medikal</Li><Li> Cook Medical</Li><Li> CellCura</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;North AmericaPreimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the North AmericaPreimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market apart.
