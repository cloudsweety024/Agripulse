For toddlers aged 1 to 3 years, push cars are often designed to enhance motor skills and coordination. These cars typically feature sturdy designs, with safety-focused elements such as low seating and stable bases. As children grow older, push cars are adapted for preschoolers, focusing on more advanced functionalities such as steering capabilities and interactive features. This segmentation ensures that each stage of a child's growth is supported by appropriate products that cater to their evolving needs and preferences. Manufacturers are increasingly innovating in this space to provide customizable options that can transition with the child from early stages to more independent play.</p><p>Furthermore, the market also divides into applications based on the type of terrain the push cars are intended for.
